# Movies-Trailer-Generator
In this project, I developed an automated system for creating movie trailers. The project comprises several building blocks:

The most important models of the project are the "spoiler detector" and "scene to frame" models. 

The purpose of these models is to identify if some scene represented by text contains spoilers or not, given the movie plot, and to identify the exact frame where the scene occurs in the film, respectively.

To address these challenges, I utilized machine learning models such as logistic regression and random forest, among others. Additionally, I used OpenAI models like GPT and CLIP.
